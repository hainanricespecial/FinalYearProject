This final year project is a word game based on Shiritori, a word chain game originated in Japan.

This project is also written in React Native and uses the Expo framework for the development.
Due to incompabilities with packages used for this project and Expo Snack, this project is 
developed and debugged **LOCALLY** and using physical mobile devices via Expo GO.

The devices used for the project are:
- **iPhone 14 Pro Max** for **iOS**  
- **Samsung Galaxy Note 9** for **Android**

*The UI is designed around these devices so certain elements of the UI might not display as expected if using
any other devices.*

If you wish to try the program yourself, you can download the repo and run it via Expo CLI.
If you do not have an Expo CLI, you might wish to download it beforehand.

You would also need to download Expo GO via the App Store on your devices beforehand.

After downloading/cloning the Github repo, you can use the command prompt to navigate to the project folder
and type the command:

`npx expo start`

to generate a QR code for your devices to run the application.
